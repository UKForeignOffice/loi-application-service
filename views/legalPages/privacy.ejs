    <h2 class="heading-medium">Who we are</h2>

    <p>The Legalisation Office, Consular Directorate<br>
      which is part of the<br>
      Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office<br>
      King Charles Street<br>
      London<br>
      SW1A 2AH<br><br>
      <a href="mailto:Legalisation.Enquiries@fcdo.gov.uk" target="_top">Legalisation.Enquiries@fcdo.gov.uk</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="heading-medium">What data we process and why</h2>

    <p>The FCDO works in the UK and overseas to safeguard Britain’s national security, build Britain’s prosperity and support British citizens overseas.  In doing so we process personal data.</p>

    <p>The Legalisation Office is responsible for legalising UK public documents. Individuals applying to get documents legalised are required to provide personal data which is essential for the delivery of the service. This data includes your name, contact details, details of your documents and the addresses to which you want documents returned.</p>

    <p>We use this information to deliver the legalisation service, and you may be contacted by officers from the Legalisation Office about your application. If you choose to create an account for repeat use of this service, you'll have the additional option to store payment and contact details and view recent applications.</p>

    <p>This service may contain free-text fields in which you are invited to enter additional comments relating to the selected service. You should not enter sensitive information into these free-text fields. Sensitive information may include, but is not limited to, details of medical history, religious beliefs and financial information.</p>

    <p>Contact details such as telephone numbers and email addresses are used to help collect payment and communicate with the customer should the need arise.</p>

    <p>Legalisation Office staff are required to validate the authenticity of documents that UK public officials have signed. As signatories to the <a href="https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/specialised-sections/apostille" target="_blank"  rel="external" >Convention of 5 October 1961 Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents<span class="visually-hidden"> opens in new window</span></a> we are required to obtain and indefinitely store copies of signatures of UK public officials.</p>

    <h2 class="heading-medium">Legal basis for the processing</h2>

    <p>We process this data because it is necessary to do so to perform our official function, as a government department, namely legalisation of UK public documents.</p>

    <h2 class="heading-medium">What we do with it</h2>

    <p>The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office uses and retains the personal data of legalisation applicants for the purposes of the reliable and secure provision of this service. In order to process legalisation applications, personal data is stored electronically in a number of areas:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Online web portal. The portal stores application details securely including name, address, contact details and recently submitted applications. Dormant accounts are automatically de-activated after 12 months.</li>
      <li>Electronic legalisation database. Customer details stored include name, address, e-mail, telephone number, and the category of the document being legalised. Personal contact details are used to contact the customer should any problems arise with their application. The database also enables Legalisation Office staff to collect payments through a securely integrated Barclaycard interface. This data includes basic historical payment information (e.g. amount paid, date processed).</li>
      <li>Barclaycard Smart Pay. Legalisation Office staff are sometimes required to collect payments directly from the customer via telephone. This involves collecting payment card details to process the transaction. Any card details collected are immediately destroyed.</li>
      <li>Third party courier supplier. The electronic legalisation database sends personal information to a third party courier (name, address, e-mail, telephone number) to ensure the successful return of documents to customers. Sometimes our supplier may need to utilise an additional third party supplier when delivering documents to remote locations in both the UK and overseas.</li>
      <li>Third party telephony call centre. The call centre may take personal details such as name, telephone number and email address when escalating an enquiry to the Legalisation Office.</li>
    </ul>
