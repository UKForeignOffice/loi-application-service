        <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
        <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and
            VoiceOver
        </li>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>
    <p>The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance
        with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>




    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Compliance status</h2>
    <p>Currently, the website does not meet all requirements of the WCAG 2.1 AA standard, and is therefore not yet
        compliant.</p>




    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non-accessible content</h2>
    <p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>




    <h3 class="govuk-heading-l">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-l">Forms</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Form fields</strong> have been used that are not labelled so screen reader users may find it difficult
        to
        determine its
        purpose when browsing both in and out of context. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 Info and
        Relationships (Level A) and 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A).
    </p>

    <p>
        We plan to make sure that all form fields are labelled and done so descriptively by October 2020. When we
        publish
        new content, we’ll make sure our use of form elements meets accessibility standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some <strong>form fields</strong> have not been grouped together with a common label. This means that people
        that
        use a screen reader will find it difficult to understand the which form fields are related. This fails WCAG 2.1
        success criterion 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A).
    </p>
    <p>
        We plan to make sure that form fields are labelled and done so descriptively by October 2020. When we publish
        new
        content, we’ll make sure our use of form elements meets accessibility standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some form fields were not descriptive. This means that people that use a screen reader may find it difficult to
        understand the form fields purpose. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.6 Headings and Labels – Level
        AA.
    </p>
    <p>
        We plan to make sure that all form fields are labelled and done so descriptively by October 2020. When we
        publish
        new content, we’ll make sure our use of form elements meets accessibility standards.
    </p>




    <h3 class="govuk-heading-l">Links</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Links</strong> that open in a new window do not inform users that this will happen. This means that
        people can be
        disorientated when the new window appears. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.2.5 Change on Request (Level
        AAA).
    </p>
    <p>
        We plan to ensure that all links that result in a new window opening inform people prior to selecting by October
        2020. When we publish new content, we’ll make sure that links inform people that a new window will open prior to
        selecting to meet the accessibility standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are <strong>skip links</strong> to skip users to form fields that contain errors that do not function as
        expected on the
        pages throughout the service. This means that people that navigate with a keyboard are unable to jump straight
        to the main content. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks (Level A).
    </p>
    <p>
        We plan to ensure that all pages will have a functioning skip link by October 2020. When we publish new content,
        we will make sure that bypassing blocks of content meets the accessibility standards.
    </p>




    <h3 class="govuk-heading-l">Mark-up</h3>
    <p>
        The correct roles and states have not been used on all areas of the service. This means that assistive
        technologies may not be able gather information about, activate or keep up to date with the status of controls.
        This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A).
    </p>
    <p>
        We plan to ensure that all roles are correct by October 2020. When we publish new content, we’ll make sure that
        the roles used meet the accessibility standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        The correct mark-up has not been used on some form fields. This means that assistive technologies may not be
        able
        to relay information to the user correctly. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.1 Parsing (Level A).
    </p>
    <p>
        We plan to ensure that all parsing errors are corrected by October 2020. When we publish new content, we’ll make
        sure that the roles used meet the accessibility standards.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-l">Disproportionate burden</h3>

    <p>The payment forms of our application are built and hosted through a third party software and we have no control
        on making changes which could improve accessibility:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Images</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Non-descriptive alt text</strong> has been used on some images so people using a screen reader cannot
        understand the
        purpose of the image. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A).</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-l">Colour</h3>
    <p>The contrast of <strong>non-text content</strong> did not meet the expected ratio of 1.3:1 where borders on form
        fields were used. This means that it may be difficult for people with low vision and/or colour deficiencies to
        know
        where to input information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (Level AA).</p>
    <p>We’ve assessed the cost of fixing the above issues and changing the payment provider now would be a
        disproportionate
        burden within the meaning of accessibility regulations. We will make another assessment when we are able to
        change
        supplier.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h2>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-l">PDFs and other documents</h3>
    <p>
        Some of our PDFs and Word documents are essential to providing our services. For example, we have PDFs with
        information on how users can access our services, and forms published as Word documents. By September 2020, we
        plan
        to either fix these or replace them with accessible HTML pages.
    </p>
    <p>The accessibility regulations <a class="govuk-link"
                                        href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made">do not
            require
            us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018</a> if
        they’re not essential to providing our services. For example, we do not plan to fix
    </p>

    <p>
        Any new PDFs or Word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.
    </p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
    <p>We are planning further accessibility improvements based on the findings from a comprehensive accessibility audit
        that was carried out in September 2020 in the coming months beginning in October 2020.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
    <p>This statement was prepared on 21st September 2020 . It was last reviewed on 21st September 2020.</p>
    <p>This website was last tested on 17th September 2020. The test was carried out by <a class="govuk-link" href="">The
            Digital Accessibility Centre</a> and covered the following journeys, which are representative of the main
        templates used on the website.</p>
