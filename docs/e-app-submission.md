Uploaded files are not put into the DB until the user clicks 'Continue' on the check your documents/application page because by this stage they've done all their uploading and deleting and have made up their mind, (I'm assuming).

Once they hit continue here, they're happy with what they have and are happy to proceed to payment.

Risks: If a user hits continue here and then goes back (somehow) to delete documents, the doucment they delete is NOT removed from the database.
